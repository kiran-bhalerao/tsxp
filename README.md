# Problem

I have experienced this, maintaning express.js app it quite challenging when you are not solo developer in your team. I've seen people following defferent patters/approch in same express.js project. so we need something which set some boundaries, which push us to write clean and maintainble code and something more than just boilerplate.

# Solution

There is a great solution available in market even before @tsxp is [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/), for enterprise application Nest.js is really good choice.
But (there is a but, there is a innovation 😃) learning curve for Nest.js is massive specially your background is from Express.js/React.js.

I wanted something as simpler as Express.js so i started working on @tsxp.

# Suggestion

@tsxp is a fun project. it is still in beta, it is still evolving. if you think you need something more stable i'll recommend you to go with [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/). Nest.js has a great community support & experienced maintainers.

# Install

```sh
npx @tsxp/cli project-name
```
